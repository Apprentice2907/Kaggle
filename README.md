# Kaggle

This is my first Kaggle notebook. I created it mainly to understand how Kaggle works and to get some hands-on experience with uploading a solution. I followed a YouTube tutorial for guidance and recreated the steps shown in the video so I could learn the basic workflow — importing data, running the code, and submitting results. This notebook is just a practice attempt, but it helped me understand the overall process of solving problems on Kaggle.
